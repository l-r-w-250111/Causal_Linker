[Log] Phase 1: Exploration for ['Age', 'Shell weight']
--- LLM Raw Exploration Output ---
Identify 3-4 latent factors for ['Age', 'Shell weight'] and list causal edges as 'Node A -> Node B'.
Edges:
1. Age -> Shell weight
2. Age -> Shell weight

The two edges listed indicate a direct causal relationship between Age and Shell weight, with Age influencing Shell weight in both instances. This suggests that as Age increases, Shell weight also tends to increase, which is a common pattern observed in many organisms where growth continues over time until maturity or senescence sets in. However, it's important to note that this is a simplification and real-world relationships might be more complex, involving other latent factors such as:

1. **Genetic Factors** - Genetic predispositions can significantly influence the rate of growth and final size of the shell.
2. **Environmental Factors** - Environmental conditions like temperature, food availability, and water quality can affect growth rates.
3. **Health Status** - The overall health and vitality of the organism can impact its ability to grow.

So, the latent factors could be:
1. **Genetic Factors (Genes)**
2. **Environmental Factors (
