[Log] Phase 1: Exploration for ['Age', 'Shell weight']
--- LLM Raw Discovery Output ---
Identify all causal edges between ['Age', 'Shell weight'] and latent factors. Format: 'A -> B'.
Edges:

- Age -> Shell weight
To identify all causal edges between the observed variables "Age" and "Shell weight" and any potential latent factors, we need to consider the possible underlying influences that might affect both of these variables. However, since no specific latent factors are provided in the problem statement, I'll assume some common latent factors that could influence both "Age" and "Shell weight."

Let's consider the following latent factors:
1. Genetic Predisposition
2. Environmental Conditions

Now, let's establish the causal edges based on these assumptions:

1. **Genetic Predisposition**
   - Genetic Predisposition can influence both "Age" and "Shell weight." For example, genetic factors can affect growth patterns and development, which would impact shell weight.
   - Therefore, we have: **Genetic Predisposition -> Age** and **Genetic Predisposition -> Shell weight**

2. **Environmental Conditions**
   - Environmental conditions such as nutrition, temperature, and habitat quality can affect both "Age" and "Shell weight."
   - Therefore, we have: **Environmental Conditions -> Age** and **Environmental Conditions -> Shell weight**

Combining these, the complete set of causal edges is:

- **Genetic Predisposition -> Age**
- **Genetic Predisposition -> Shell weight**
- **Environmental Conditions -> Age**
- **Environmental Conditions -> Shell weight**

So, the final list of causal edges is:

- **Genetic Predisposition ->
