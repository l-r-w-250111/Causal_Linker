Input: A man walks on a street.

  LLM: Extract all important words (nouns and verbs) from: "A man walks on a street."

Output format: <entities>word1, word2, word3</entities>

Answer: <entities>man, walks, street</entities>
You have correctly extracted the important words (nouns and verbs) from the sentence. Here is the output in the requested format:

<entities>
[Factual Nodes] ['man', 'walk', 'street']

Stage 1 Complete.

STAGE 2: Counterfactual Analysis
============================================================
Input: What would have happened if a man had walked on a bed?

  LLM: Extract all important words (nouns and verbs) from: "What would have happened if a man had walked on a bed?"

Output format: <entities>word1, word2, word3</entities>

Answer: <entities>walked, man, bed</entities>
To extract the important words (nouns and verbs) from the given sentence, we need to identify the key action and the subjects involved.
[Counterfactual Nodes] ['walk', 'man', 'bed']

INTERVENTION DETECTED:
  'street' -> 'bed'

LLM output:

You are doing strict counterfactual reasoning.

FACTUAL WORLD:
A man walks on a street.

COUNTERFACTUAL CHANGE (do-intervention):
Replace street with bed.
Assume EVERYTHING ELSE about the world remains the same
(the man, his purpose, his schedule, his location, his goal).

QUESTION:
What would most likely have happened?

Options:
