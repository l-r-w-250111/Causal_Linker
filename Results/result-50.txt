Step 1: Identifying Causal Disruption...
Intervention: 'street' removed. Assessing system integrity.
Step 2: Calculating Causal Metrics...
 - Causal Synchrony Index (CSI): 0.000000

Step 3: Step-by-Step Reasoning:
 1. Factual context: Walking on a street leads to a destination.
 2. Counterfactual: Walking on a bed replaces the street surface.
 3. Physical Analysis: A bed lacks the structural causal link to 'Destination' in the transport domain.
 4. System Response: The causal chain is disconnected. No arrival-related outcome is triggered.
