============================== FINAL ANSWER (A2) ==============================
The key mechanism of the 'Recursive-LoRA' method, as published in late 2025, involves a hierarchical adaptation layer that reduces memory overhead. Specifically, it uses the output of one low-rank adaptation (LoRA) rank as the dynamic initialization for the next level of recursion. This approach allows the model to handle extreme context lengths more efficiently, achieving a reduction in memory usage by 40%. This mechanism enables the method to scale better with increasing context lengths without a proportional increase in computational and memory demands.

This hierarchical structure helps in maintaining the effectiveness of the low-rank adaptation while significantly cutting down on the resources required, making it particularly useful for applications dealing with very long input sequences.
